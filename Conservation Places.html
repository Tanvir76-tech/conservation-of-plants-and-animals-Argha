<p><font size=5><b>Wildlife Sanctuary -</b> A wildlife sanctuary is an area where animals and birds can live protected and safe in their natural habitats, away from poaching or trafficking. It is also known as a natural reserve, biosphere reserve or a nature conservation area. It is an area where not only the animals are protected but the flora as well as other geological features are conserved and maintained either to be studied or for research purposes. They can be under the direct care of the government or can be owned by private charities and research institutions. In sanctuaries there are strict rules against killing, capturing and poaching of the animals. One of the main reasons they are established is for the protection of endangered species.</font></p>
<p><font size=5><b>National park -</b> A national park is a park or a area of land officially recognized and protected by a nation's government. National parks are often made to protect the animals that live inside them or the land itself. There are many National Parks in the world.The first one established (in 1872) was the United States Yellowstone National Park. It was the first national park in the world. But the idea of protecting areas from human development was proposed years earlier. American painter George Catlin offered the idea during the 1830s.An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined National Parks as its category II type of protected areas. The largest national park in the world meeting the IUCN definition is the Northeast Greenland National Park, which was established in 1974. According to the IUCN, there are about 7000 national parks worldwide (2010 figure).</font></p>
<p><font size=5><b>Zoological Parks -</b>A zoo (short for zoological garden; also called an animal park or menagerie) is a facility in which animals are housed within enclosures, cared for, displayed to the public, and in some cases bred for conservation purposes. The term zoological garden refers to zoology, the study of animals. The term is derived from the Greek 'animal', and the suffix 'study of'. The abbreviation zoo was first used of the London Zoological Gardens, which was opened for scientific study in 1828 and to the public in 1847. In the United States alone, zoos are visited by over 181 million people annually.
