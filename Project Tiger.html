<p><font size=5>Tiger is the national animal of India. As the national animal of India, tiger symbolises India’s wildlife wealth. It is chosen as the national animal for the combination of grace, strength, agility and enormous power. Also, India is home to the largest number of tigers in the world and consists of approximately 50% of the world’s tiger population. Yet this creature is the most slaughtered one in the country, so much so that it was on a verge of getting extinct. It was in 1970, that the alarm was raised and thus hunting of tigers was made illegal.</font></p>
