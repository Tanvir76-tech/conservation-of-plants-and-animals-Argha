<center><h1>What is migration?</h1></center>
<p><font size=5>Migration refers to permanent or semi-permanent change in the place of residence of an individual or a group of individuals from one location to another. Hence, it is different from the more general term mobility, which refers to all types of movements of people (Rubenstein and Bacon, 1990:75). Thus, the term mobility includes both permanent (and semi-permanent) and temporary movements of people over the earth. With regard to temporary movements, the examples of which have already been cited above, a distinction is generally made between a cyclic and a periodic movement.A cyclic movement includes short duration trips to place of work (i.e., commuting), or frequent business trips of people in business, or movement of nomads, which is compara­tively irregular in timings. A periodic movement, on the other hand, involves a longer period of residence away from home base than that in the cyclic movement (Blij and Muller, 1986:103). Periodic movement includes the movement of students away to other locations for the purpose of studies, or the movements of military personnel to military base, training schools or combat zones.The movements of migrant labourers and their families are also periodic movements, although they are more cyclic than that of students or military personnel. Still another form of periodic movement is what is commonly known as transhumance – a system of pastoral farming in the mountainous areas wherein people keep changing their abodes along with their livestock between high slopes in the summer and lower valleys in the winter.Migration, a permanent move, involves crossing over of the boundary of an administrative unit. When the national boundary of a country is involved, such movements are called international migration. Similarly, if migration takes place within the national boundary of a country, it is termed as internal migration. In the case of international migration the departure of an individual or a group from a country is termed as emigration, while arrival or entry into a country is known as immigration.The equivalent terms in respect to internal migration are out-migration and in-migration. In fact, each movement is simultaneously emigration (or out-migration) for the place of origin or departure, and immigration (or in-migration) for the place of destination.Gross migration refers to the total number of migrants moving into and moving out of a place, region or country, while net migration is the balance between the number of migrants coming into and moving out of a place, region or country.In other words, net migration is the gain or loss in the total population of an area as a result of migration. Migration stream is a term used for spatial mobility in which the migrants have a common place of origin and common place of destination. A variety of factors can cause migration of individuals. While the factors leading to migration can be classified into several categories, in general term people take decisions to migrate based on push and pull factors.</font></p>
