<h1><center>Climate and Adaptations</center></h1>
<p><font size=5><center>The ability of an organism to develop certain features which improve the chances of its survival in the environment in which they live, is known as <b>Adaptations</b>. Animals are adapted to survive in the conditions in which they live. In other words, an adaptation is a trait of an organism that has been favoured by natural selection.</center></font></p>
